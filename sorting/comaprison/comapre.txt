1. Bubble Sort
Time Complexity: O(n²) (average/worst)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stability: Stable
Best Case: O(n) (already sorted)
Worst Case: O(n²) (reverse order)
Use Case: Very small datasets, mostly sorted data


2. Selection Sort
Time Complexity: O(n²) (average/worst)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stability: Unstable
Best Case: O(n²)
Worst Case: O(n²)
Use Case: Small datasets, when memory is constrained


3. Insertion Sort
Time Complexity: O(n²) (average/worst)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stability: Stable
Best Case: O(n) (already sorted)
Worst Case: O(n²) (reverse order)
Use Case: Small datasets, mostly sorted data


4. Quick Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average) / O(n²) (worst)
Space Complexity: O(log n)
Stability: Unstable
Best Case: O(n log n) (balanced partition)
Worst Case: O(n²) (unbalanced partition)
Use Case: Large datasets, fast in-place sorting


5. Merge Sort
Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average/worst)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Stability: Stable
Best Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)
Use Case: Large datasets, when stability is required


Comparative Summary

1.Best for Small Datasets: Insertion Sort (if nearly sorted) or Selection Sort (if memory is constrained).
2.Fastest for Large Datasets: Quick Sort (generally fastest in practice), Merge Sort (guaranteed O(n log n) performance and stability).
3.Memory Usage: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort are memory-efficient (O(1)); Merge Sort requires additional space (O(n)).
4.Stability: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort are stable; Selection Sort and Quick Sort are not.

Choosing the Right Algorithm:

1.Consider Dataset Size: Use simpler sorts for small or nearly sorted datasets; opt for Quick or Merge Sort for larger datasets.
2.Evaluate Stability Needs: Use stable sorts (Bubble, Insertion, Merge) when the order of equal elements matters.
3.Memory Constraints: Choose in-place algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick) for limited memory environments.
